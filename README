dput â€” Debian package upload toolkit

Dput is a tool for uploading packages into Debian.


Features
========

The features include:

* Test of the GnuPG signature on the source control file (``*.dsc``).

* Verification of the checksums in the source control file.

* Support for MD5 and SHA checksums.

* Check for unnecessary or missing tarballs.

* Running Lintian before putting the package into the archive.

* Running Dinstall after the package is in the archive and making sure that
  the package will be put on the correct server.

* Running user-defined commands before and after an upload.

A lot of the tests can be run without really putting the package
into the archive.
